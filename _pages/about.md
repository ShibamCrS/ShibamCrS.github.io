![Overview Of Cryptanalysis](/images/cryptanalysis.png){: width="512px"}


I'm a final year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.

I am working with Prof. Orr Dunkelman.

I completed my master's thesis as a research intern at INRIA, Paris, under the guidance of Anne Canteaut and Leo Perrin.

My research interests are in design and analysis of symmetric-key cryptosystems.
